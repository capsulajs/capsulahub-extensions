Feature: Create Environment registry extension for CapsulaHub

Background:
   Given Workspace
   And   EnvRegistry extension

Scenario: EnvRegistry extension bootstrap function resolves correctly and triggers the registration of an instance of EnvRegistry in Workspace
   Given A valid EnvRegistry configuration with a token and configProvider
   When  EnvRegistry extension bootstrap function is called with a Workspace as a first argument and EnvRegistry configuration as a second argument
   Then  Correct EnvRegistry configuration is applied while creating an instance of EnvRegistryService
   And   The registration of EnvRegistryService in Workspace is triggered with the correct arguments
   And   The promise, that is returned from the call of the bootstrap function, resolves with no args
   And   The returned promise from a call of registration function is resolved (only after the resolve of bootstrap function)

Scenario: EnvRegistry extension bootstrap function rejects with an error if the creation of an instance of EnvRegistry throws an error
   Given An invalid EnvRegistry configuration with a token and configProvider
   When  EnvRegistry extension bootstrap function is called with a Workspace as a first argument and EnvRegistry configuration as a second argument
   And   The creation of EnvRegistryService instance fails with an error "Error1"
   Then  The promise, that is returned from the call of the bootstrap function, rejects with an error "Error1"
   And   The registration of the service in Workspace was not triggered
